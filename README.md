# Example JS Callback Activities

These were activities I wrote for my classes to better help students understand and familiarize themselves with callback functions in Javascript. At this point, students have already been writing scripts in Node, so the activities were meant to be run from the command line.

  * [01-Callback-Example](./01-Callback-Example/callbacks.js) was a single JS file meant to be a class discussion as we walk through the basics of callbacks together.

  * [02-Text-File-Module](./02-Text-File-Module) was a student activity where the instructions specified exactly how to solve the async problem with callbacks.

  * [03-Omdb-Module](./03-Omdb-Module) had less starter code but was meant to show a real-world use for building modules with constructors and callbacks.
